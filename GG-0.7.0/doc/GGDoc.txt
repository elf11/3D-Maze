/** \page design Design
    \section design_purpose Purpose 
    GG is designed to achieve several goals:
    - Platform-independence: GG should be buildable on any platform that supports OpenGL
    - Driver-independence: GG should be a standalone GUI framework that does not require any particular application framework;
    though SDL and Ogre drivers are supplied, GG should be usable with any driver code the user wishes to supply
    - Easy extensibility: new controls and GUI behavior should be easy to incorporate
    - Complete graphical control for the user/designer: the user should not be limited by the author's lack of artistic skill!
    - Independence of UI elements from the source code: GG UI elements should be configurable as text files, so that UI design 
    and alteration should not require a recompilation
    - Overall time efficiency: an application with a reasonable number of GG UI elements should not slow down significantly 
    because of the rendering or handling of those elements
    - Overall space efficiency: each GG UI element should have a reasonably small data size
    - Efficient mixture of 2D and 3D graphical elements: it should be appropriate to use GG in any frame-based 3D application, 
    even a realtime 3D video game
    - Simplicity of use: GG UI elements should be able to send arbitrary messages when manipulated by the user; there should be 
    no message passing hierarchy imposed on the user

    \section design_features Features
    GG has the following features and services:
    - Communication of UI controls via signals and slots
    - Support for 2D-, 3D-, and mixed-mode rendering
    - Managment of textures and fonts
    - Serialization of UI elements

    \section nonfeatures Non-Features
    - GG is not fully threadsafe, due to its use of signals and slots
    - No sound support is provided

/** \page architecture Architecture
    \section arch_rendering Rendering Overview
    GG uses OpenGL to render its graphics.  It is assumed that the entire GUI is being redrawn multiple times each second, as part of a high-framerate application.  
    Each GG UI element is draw using calls to OpenGL.  Therefore, each element can be rendered as a pre-rendered pixmap, flat 2D 
    texture or sprite, or even a fully 3D rendering; the complexity of the graphics used to represent the UI elements is only limited
    by the target rendering hardware and the user's skill.
    \section arch_UI_overview UI Overview
    \subsection arch_input_events Input Events
    GG is organized as a layer on top of an existing user input framework.  GG has no way of determining that a mouse click, mouse move, 
    or any other user input event, has taken place.  To use GG, one must subclass off of the abstract class GG::GUI, and define several 
    of GG::GUI's pure virtual functions.  These functions poll the underlying operating system or input framework,
    and generate GG input messages from them.  Such messages are mouse moves and clicks, key presses and releases, joystick movement, 
    etc. GG maintains internal state as to what part of the GUI is being dragged, clicked, etc.
    \subsection arch_UI_overview_example Example:
    Suppose the user clicks 
    the left mouse button at screen position (50, 37).  GG will receive a message from the underlying application framework that a 
    left mouse click has occurred; it then determines what UI element is under that screen location, if any.  If it turns out there is
    a button under that spot, GG sets internal state indicating that the left mouse button is being held down, and that it is over the
    button.  GG then sends a message to the button that it is depressed.  The button sets its own internal state and returns.  All 
    processing is complete for this input; the next time the button is redrawn, it knows to draw itself in a depressed state.  Very
    little computation is involved in processing a single user input event.  GG's performance is therefore usually limited only by the
    application-defined processing that is associated with manipulating the controls (e.g., a button click may trigger disk IO).
   \subsection arch_UI_element_conns UI Element Connections
    GG UI elements are connected using signals and slots, using the boost.signals library.  This allows arbitrary 
    connections between one control and another, and between a control and any other code; there is no hierarchy of passed messages 
    as there is in some other GUIs, and no type-unsafe callbacks are used.  Refer to the \ref sigs_n_slots documentation for details.
    \subsection arch_gui_services GG::GUI Services
    The singleton GG::GUI object is globally available through a static member function, GG::GUI::GetGUI().  This allows all code
    in the application to rely on GG::GUI for certain essential services.  GUI-specific services include registering windows into
    the GUI, registering windows as always-on-top or modal windows, moving windows up or down in the z-order layers of the GUI,
    removing windows from the GUI, getting mouse state (position and button depression), setting mouse delay repeat (see GG::GUI 
    for a description of this), entering and exiting from an orthographic projection (2D) rendering mode, and saving/loading polymorphic
    GUI elements to/from their serialized form.  Most of these services must be provided by the user when subclassing from GG::GUI; 
    if either of SDLGUI or OgreGUI is used, these services are already implemented.
    <p>
    GG::GUI does a variety of things for the user, some of which are not strictly necessary for the core GUI functionality.  
    GG::GUI provides limited timing info via FPS() and DeltaT().  These are provided to indicate how fast the GUI is rendering, 
    and how long it has been since the last frame was rendered.  There is also a font manager, an application-wide font "pool",
    from which the user can request fonts.  The font pool loads and stores the fonts as needed by the application, and multiple 
    requests for the same font at the same size will result in the creation of only one font object.  A texture manager
    exists which does a similar job with textures.  If the user wants to programmatically create textures, she can also add them
    to the texture pool, provide a name, and request that texture as many times as needed.  OpenGL texture objects are used as
    the underlying texture rendering method.

/** \page sigs_n_slots Signals and Slots
    \section sigs_n_slots_definition Sig-who? Slo-what?
    If you've never been exposed to the signals and slots pattern before, it can be a little confusing.  Simply put, a slot is a
    function or function object that is "listening" for a signal.  A slot "listening" to a certain signal is said to be connected 
    to that signal.  When a signal is emitted, all slots that are connected to that signal are called (since they are all functions/function
    objects).  If a signal is emitted to which no slots are connected, nothing happens.
    \section sigs_n_slots_motivation Motivation for the Signals and Slots Pattern
    \subsection prob The Problem
    Originally, GG used a very simple strategy for passing messages between windows/controls.  The method was to call a
    Command() function, which passed to the callee an integer representing the type of message (button click, scroll, or
    whatever), an ID number associated with the calling control, and a single integer parameter.  It could have been
    made more general and even less typesafe by replacing the int parameter with a void pointer, but in either case it
    suffers from two huge limitations.  First, the type of message and the parameter must be known to both caller and
    callee; this means that, for example, the user must keep track of the integer value representing a button click
    message, and make sure that separate sections of code are using the same value to represent it.  Second, any code
    that doesn't contain a control, but that wants to know about button pushes, scrolling scrollbars, etc., must deal
    with that control's parent (or break encapsulation).  This creates a lot of chains of passed messages, and a large
    number of kludges to get messages to the sections of code that need them.
    \subsection sigs_n_slots_soln The Solution
    Now, each control emits a signal every time a significant event occurs.  If no processing needs to be associated
    with such an event, its signal need not be connected to anything.  Futhermore, no matter how many modules need to
    react to a certain signal, they can all be connected.
    \section sigs_n_slots_use Using Signals and Slots
    \subsection sigs_n_slots_connecting Connecting Signals To Slots
    There are two types of connections between signals and slots.  The first type of connection is between a signal and
    a slot, which may be a functor (which in turn may be a boost::bind object), a free function or a static member
    function or function object.  Just call Connect(sig, slot).  The second type is between a signal and a non-static
    member function.  In this case, the call to Connect() requires a third parameter: a pointer to the object whose
    member function is to be called.  For instance, if I have a class Foo and an object foo1 of class Foo, I cannot call
    foo1.bar() by simply knowing the address of bar().  I need to call Connect(sig, &Foo::bar, &foo1) so that the signal
    knows which object's bar() to call.  Both versions of Connect() return a connection object.  By keeping this
    connection object, you can later disconnect() the connection you made.  In addition, signal-signal connections are
    possible.  Calling Connect(sig1, sig2) forwards all sig1's signal emissions to sig2.  This is provided as a
    convenience to avoid having to write dummy forwarding functions that do this.
    \subsection sigs_n_slots_emitting Emitting Signals
    To emit a signal from a signal object "sig", just use its function call operator ("operator()"), like this: "sig();"
    \subsection disconnecting Disconnecting Signals and Slots
    If you kept the connection object returned by Connect(), a connection_obj.disconnect() call will disconnect the associated 
    signal and slot.  Also, consider this: what happens if a signal A is connected to a slot consisting of a member function
    of object B, B is deleted, and then A() is called?  A segfault, unless the B's class inherits from 
    boost::trackable, which auto-disconnects slots in its destructor.  GG::Wnd is derived from boost::trackable, so all 
    GG::Wnd-derived classes should handle such situations gracefully.  See the boost tutorial below for details.
    \see http://boost.org/doc/html/signals.html for a tutorial on other aspects of signals and slots; you can create 
    connections that have scope, control the order of the invocation of multiple slots that are called by a signal, and combine 
    the return values of such slots (take the first return value, the last, the average of all of them, etc.).
*/

/** \page drag_n_drop Drag and Drop
    \section drag_n_drop_basics Basics
    GG has drag and drop support that allows you to drag any Wnd and drop it onto any other Wnd.  The results of this
    drop depend on the two Wnds involved.  Each Wnd has a DragDropDataType() method that returns a string describing
    what kind of data the Wnd represents.  The string can be a MIME type or any arbitrary string the user likes.  Upon
    the drop, the Wnd receiving the drop has its AcceptDrop() method called, in which it can examine the data type or
    any other relevant aspects of the dropped Wnd and decide whether or not to accept it.  If the receiver accepts, the
    dropped Wnd is removed from its parent, if it has one.  Note that only Wnds with non-empty DragDropDataType() or
    Wnds that were created with the DRAGABLE (both not both!) may be drag-and-dropped.  A DRAGABLE Wnd is draggable as long as
    it is not the child of another Wnd, and as it is dragged, it moves across the screen normally.  A Wnd with a
    non-empty DragDropDataType() string does not move when drag-and-dropped; instead, it is rendered in its original place,
    and a copy of it is rendered as if the cursor were dragging it.
    \section drag_n_drop_advanced Advanced Use
    There is an extensive set of notification functions that may be called during a drag and drop operation.  The drop target
    and the orginal parent of the dragged Wnd(s), if any, may be notified of various events or queried (e.g. AcceptDrop()).
    See the Wnd documentation for details.
    <p>Sometimes it is desirable to have the drop-receiving Wnd emit a signal to which clients may attach slots.  Further,
    it may be desirable to allow the attached client slots to veto the drop.  If this is desired, the recommended means
    of accomplishing this is to follow the pattern of ListBox.  ListBox catches ListBox::DontAcceptDrop exceptions that
    are thrown in slots attached to its DroppedSignal signal.  The signal is emitted after the drop is completed, and if
    DontAcceptDrop is caught, the stack is unwound in two steps.  First, the insertion of the dropped item is rolled
    back, and then the exception is rethrown so that AcceptDrop() can return false.  See the ListBox implementation for
    further details.

/** \page building Building GG
    \section building_reqs Requirements
    GG requires GCC 3.4 or later, or MSVC++ 8.0 SP1 or later.  Note that both are available for free download.
    <p>
    GG relies on a few other open-source libraries:
    - DevIL 1.6.1 - http://openil.sourceforge.net
    - FreeType 2.1.2 - http://www.freetype.org
    - boost 1.34 - http://www.boost.org

    Optional libraries for input drivers:
    - SDL 1.2.7 - http://www.libsdl.org
    - Ogre 1.4.7 - http://ogre3d.org

    GG's documentation relies on Doxygen (http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen). In the GG/doc directory, run Doxygen; the 
    documentation will appear in the GG/doc/html directory.
    <br>

    \section howto_build How To Build GG

    \subsection howto_build_all_platforms All Platforms
    You will need to have first built the buildable portions of the boost libraries.  See http://boost.org/more/getting_started/index.html for details on building boost.  There are usually pre-built binaries available for download for the latest Microsoft C++ compiler.

    \subsection howto_build_linux Linux
    To build GG, you will need to have SCons installed.  These libraries and all the boost
    includes should be available in your path.  You will of course also need to build and make available all of
    the libraries listed in the requirements above.
   
    Once this is done, Linux, Cygwin, and MinGW users can simply type
    \verbatim
      scons
      scons install [as root, if necessary]\endverbatim
    from within the root of the GG directory tree.  Type
    \verbatim
      scons -h\endverbatim
    to see all the options for the build, including specifying nonstandard locations for libraries required by GG, which may 
    be especially useful on Cygwin/MinGW systems.

    \subsection howto_build_win32_gcc Windows (GCC)

    GG works quite well with GCC on Windows, under MinGW or Cygwin, using SCons.  See the SCons documentation for how to
    force SCons to use Cygwin or MinGW on the Windows platform (this will probably only be necessary if you also have
    the MSVC compiler), then refer to the Linux section above.  Also note that the DLLs for all the required libraries
    except the boost libraries can be found on the net pre-compiled.  You can just use the ones for win32/MSVC; since
    they're all C code, there will be no ABI compatibility issues.  You must compile the boost libraries yourself, since
    they are C++ code.

    \subsection howto_build_win32_microsoft Windows (Microsoft C++)

    For those of you who use the Microsoft compiler, SCons will also work from the command line.  You need to install
    SCons and Python, and make sure that python is in your path.  There is also a standalone version of SCons available
    somewhere on the SCons site.  Then you just open up a command prompt window, cd to the root of the GG directory
    tree, and type scons.  I have only been able to get the current version of GG to compile on MSVC++ 8.0 SP1, the version
    that comes with .NET 2005.
    <p>There is experimental support for generated MSVC project files.  To enable this, you can uncomment the large
    block of commented-out lines at the end of SConstruct and near the top of build_support.py (all the lines starting
    with "##").  After this, assuming you are using a recent-enough version of SCons, scons --help should give you all
    the instructions you need ot generate MSVC project files.  Note that you can get precompiled MSVC-compatible DLLs
    for many of the required libraries.  DevIL's 1.6.5 pre-compiled library can be substituted for the latest one, if
    there is no pre-compiled version available.
    <p>
    Finally, note that the solution file is set up to grab all include and library directories rooted at c:\, not just the boost 
    ones.  If you'd like to keep them somewhere else, you'll need to change the project settings.

    \subsection howto_build_macos Macintosh
    It would be nice to have access to a Mac OS X and/or Classic Mac box, to be able to ensure that GG even compiles on such a 
    thing.  Let me know if you have or are interested in testing out a Mac build, or even taking on porting duties.
*/

/** \page serialization Serialization
    \section serialization_motivation Motivation
    One of the main design goals for GG is the editability of UI elements without recompilation.  Another main goal is the 
    capability of saving and restoring the state of the GUI.  A secondary design goal is the capability of serializing UI
    elements for network transmission and receipt.  To satisfy all these requirements, GG uses the boost.serialization 
    library to serialize Wnd-derived objects.
    \section serialization_approach Details
    GG does not contain any actual code that will serialize a Wnd.  Instead, each Wnd subclass contains a serialize() template
    method which may be invoked by user code to perform serialization.  The user must then create a boost serialization
    archive, and save/load the desired windows to/from the archive.  To be serializable, user-created subclasses need to define
    a serialize method that first serializes its base class, then serializes any subclass-specific data; see any Wnd subclass
    for example code.  For full details on how the serialization works, see the serialization tutorial and the
    boost.serialization documentation.
    \section caveats Caveats
    Signals are not currently serializable.  This means that when a class is created from an input serialization
    archive, all its signals must be reconnected to their slots (and any signals connected to it should be reconnected
    as well).  Many of the built-in GG controls must reconnect signals when loaded; such classes have a private
    ConnectSignals() method that is called at load time.  See RadioButtonGroup::serialize() in GGButton.h for an
    example.
    <p>Font and Texture objects that were part of the GUI's FontManager and TextureManager when
    saved will not be added back to these two structures when they are loaded.
*/

/** \page brief_tour A Brief Tour

    In a library as diverse in functionality as GG, it can be difficult even
    to figure out what the library has to offer.  This "tour" is designed to
    provide a brief overview of the various features of GG not covered
    elsewhere, and to point users to the more detailed information elsewhere
    in the documentation.  The topics are covered in no particular order.

    <p>

    First off, it should be noted that there is a lot of general overview-type
    documentation in the GG::Wnd and GG::GUI detailed documentation.  Many of
    the things mentioned below are covered there in more detail.

    \section tour_event_filters Event Filters

    Event filtering allows one to use a Wnd to intrusively handle the events
    sent to another Wnd.  This can be useful, for example, in a control (the
    parent) that is composed of multiple controls (the children), but which
    needs to handle certain events uniformly.  Perhaps left-clicks should
    always bring up a context menu, for instance.  Without event filtering,
    each child control would have to explicitly forward its left-clicks
    instead of processing them normally, which would in turn require
    subclassing.  Event filters remove the need for such subclassing.  \see
    The GG::Wnd description, GG::Wnd::EventFilter(),
    GG::Wnd::InstallEventFilter(), and GG::Wnd::RemoveEventFilter().

    \section tour_layouts Layouts

    GG::Layout encapsulates the relative arrangement of child Wnds in the client
    area of a Wnd, so that positioning such children requires less
    hand-coding.  \see The GG::Wnd description.

    \section tour_browse_info The Browse-Info System

    Like "tooltips", but more general.  You can have any non-interactive GUI
    elements you like inside of a GG::BrowseInfoWnd, and the contents of the
    GG::BrowseInfoWnd can vary, for example to provide increasing amounts of
    info over time.  \see The GG::Wnd description.

    \section tour_style_factory The Style Factory

    Many of the control classes reuse other controls to do part of their work.
    For instance, GG::Scroll uses a pair of GG::Button objects for its up and
    down (or left and right) buttons.  If a user wishes to use a custom
    subclass of GG::Button throughout an application, how is she to get
    GG::Scroll to create GG::Button's of the right type?  The answer is that
    all controls created by GG are requested from a GG::StyleFactory.  \see
    The GG::Wnd description and the GG::GUI description.

    \section tour_plugins Plugins

    Plugins (dynamically loaded shared libraries/DLLs not linked into the
    application when it is built) can be created and used with GG.  Plugins
    provide a GG::StyleFactory, a default font name and size, and functions to
    serialize and deserialize GG::Wnd's.  \see GG::PluginInterface.

    \section tour_standard_dialogs Standard Dialogs

    Three standard dialogs are provided:
    - A color selection dialog, GG::ColorDlg;
    - A file(s)/directory selection dialog, GG::FileDlg; and
    - A general-purpose message dialog containing at most three buttons, GG::ThreeButtonDlg.

    \section tour_cursor_rendering Cursor Rendering

    GG can optionally render a cursor.  By default, GG assumes that the
    underlying system is rendering the cursor, and so does not attempt to do
    so.  \see GG::GUI::RenderCursor(), GG::GUI::GetCursor(),
    GG::GUI::SetCursor(), and GG::Cursor.

    \section tour_flags Flags

    GG uses format flags, window creation flags, and several other types of
    bit-flag sets in various places.  These bit-flag sets are not
    interoperable.  This is designed as a workaround to problems inherent to
    C++ enums, such as implicit conversion to integral types, which in turn
    leads to comparability of arbitrary enumeration values from different
    enumerations.  For instance, it is impossible (due to a compile-time
    error) to accidentally pass the (nonsensical) flag FORMAT_NONE to the \a
    flags parameter of GG::Wnd::Wnd().  With built-in C++ enums, this would
    not be caught by the compiler.  GG provides two classes, GG::Flags and
    GG::FlagSpec, that allow the user to extend the sets of flags used in GG,
    if user-created subclasses should require more flags than the ones GG
    provides.

    \section tour_text_formatting_tags Text Formatting Tags

    Text rendered by GG can make use of text formatting tags, similar to those
    used in HTML documents (e.g. \<i><i>italicized text here</i>\</i>).  GG defines
    numerous tags that control text justification, text color, bolding,
    underlining, italicizing, etc.  Users can also add their own tags.  Though
    GG does not associate any semantics with user-defined tags, it will treat
    them as tags, meaning they will be automatically be removed from the text
    as it appears when rendered.  \see The GG::Font description.

    \section tour_keyboard_accelerators Keyboard Accelerators

    Keyboard accelerators may be established that emit signals on (and
    possibly filter out) keystrokes.  Accelerators can include a modifier
    specification, so for instance Ctrl-K, Alt-K, and K may be created as
    different accelerators.  Each accelerator has an associated signal to
    which arbitrarily many slots can be connected.  \see The GG::GUI
    description.

    \section tour_user_input_drivers User Input Drivers

    Two input drivers are currently available for use with GG -- one for
    <a href="http://libsdl.org">SDL</a> and one for
    <a href="http://ogre3d.org">Ogre</a>.  Note that Ogre does not have
    built-in support for user input.  As of this writing, it uses another
    library called <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/wgois">OIS</a>.  
    An Ogre plugin that provides OIS support is also provided in
    src/Ogre/Plugins.  \see GG::SDLGUI, GG::OgreGUI, GG::OgreGUIInputPlugin,
    and OISInput.

    \section tour_timers Timers

    Timers are available, to which slots can be connected.  A timer fires its
    signal after at least T time has elapsed, where T is a user-provided time
    interval.  Note the use of "at least".  Timers are only evaluated during
    GG's normal processing loop, so if the application is cycling slowly (due
    to heavy processing, etc.), timers can fire arbitrarily less frequently
    than desired.

    \section tour_event_pumps Event Pumps

    GG abstracts out the inner loop that processes events and renders frames,
    into a class called GG::EventPump.  Most users will never need to use
    event pumps, but those users writing a new input driver will.
